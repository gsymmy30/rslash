In the patent they talk about how this PCie card makes it easier to bring console gaming to other devices.\n\n>In some implementations, the console compute card 100 is configured for use in a cloud server environment, such as a cloud gaming server or cloud development server. In other implementations, the console compute card 100 is configured for use in a local computing environment, such as a local workstation, or a local personal computer (PC).\n\n>As a game console is a standalone device, it is not easily integrated with other systems or devices. However, by providing the console compute card 100 of the present disclosure with game console-equivalent resources in the form factor of a PCIe card, integration into server systems and other devices becomes more straightforward and additional collaborative functionality is enabled.\n\nThis sounds very similar to what Microsoft is apparently also doing.",
